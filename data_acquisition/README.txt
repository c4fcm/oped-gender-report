A folder for code to access content and extract bylines

base_meta.py Handles all of the extraction and has all the metadata for sources we cover. Working on putting this metadata into txt documents that base_meta can call.

test_script.py and evaluation_util.py has everything for testing.

All other files are from previous versions of the code.
